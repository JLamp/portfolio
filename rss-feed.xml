Reshaping the world one logo at a time with identity design legend Mackey Saturday
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
<p>What makes a logo stand the test of time? The legendary identity designer Mackey Saturday joins us on this episode of Overtime to chat all things brand identity. Mackey shares his experience redesigning the new Instagram script logo and working with Oculus and Unsplash on their new visual identities. We hear why he values a strong concept over visual aesthetic and the importance of designing logos with functionality in mind. Mackey also shares how his love for skateboarding introduced him to the world of design and the strong parallel between the two.

Passion project aficionado and hand lettering artist, Lauren Hom, joins us on Overtime to chat about the success she's found by doing the work she loves. We discuss a few of her popular projects including Flour Crowns, Will Letter for Lunch, and Daily Dishonestly. She also shares some sage advice on freelancing and how she quit her advertising art director gig to work for herself. It doesn't have to be a big jump—there are steps you can take to move the mountains closer and make it more of a hop. Lauren urges creatives to share work that's not perfect. Quality over quantity still reigns true, but quantity does have some validity in the current landscape of how we share things on social media. This episode is brought to you by [.ME](https://domain.me/landing-spot-talent/?utm_source=Overtime&utm_medium=Podcast&utm_content=Q12019).

Rob Generette III on Design Education, Getting Inspired by Sports, and What's Next After Retiring from Teaching
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
<p>Illustrator and art educator, Rob Generette III (aka Robzilla) is on Overtime this week. In this episode, Rob shares what he's learned from teaching the art and photography for the last 20 years and what he learned from his own design education. He also shares how he came to be an incredible sports illustrator and found himself drawing live on air at ESPN. He also hints at his next big project, so you'll have to listen to the episode to find out what's he's working on now.</p> <p>&quot;I didn't have anybody who recognized that skill early on, which could've changed the whole course of my life. Kind of falling back on that major conversation that we had, that was one of the driving points for me to become a teacher. I needed to be that person that somebody like me could rely on when it comes down to picking that direction, to going to. I used that as a motivational point the whole 20 years I was teaching.&quot;</p> <h3>Links Mentioned in Overtime:</h3> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/rob_zilla_iii/">Rob on Instagram</a></li> <li><a href="https://twitter.com/rob_zilla_iii">Rob on Twitter</a></li> <li><a href="https://dribbble.com/rob_zilla_iii">Rob on Dribbble</a></li> <li><a href="https://sketchbook.com/">Sketchbook Pro</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html">Adobe Illustrator</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html">Adobe Photoshop</a></li> <li><a href="https://theblog.adobe.com/adobe-ideas-a-new-name-a-new-look-a-new-app/">Adobe Ideas</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.behance.net/brianyap">Brian Yap</a></li> <li><a href="https://twitter.com/Rob_Zilla_III/status/885258003968139265">ESPN on air drawing</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/draw.html">Adobe Draw</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.behance.net/live/videos/1077">Rob's latest appearance on Adobe Live</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.adobe-max.com/connect/attendeeDetail.ww?PERSON_ID=C6B648DE48B0562462CA016DC4F440A6">Rob at Adobe Max</a></li> <li><a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/4934845-Nike-Off-White-Presto-Illustration">Nike Off-White Presto Illustration</a></li> <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-White">Off-white by Virgil Abloh</a></li> </ul> <p>Full transcript and more at <a href="https://dribbble.com/overtime">dribbble.com/overtime</a>.</p>

<description>
<![CDATA[
<p>Gerren Lamson is an Austin-based designer and the co-owner and Chief Design Officer at <a href="https://creativemarket.com/">Creative Market</a>. In this episode, we explore how Gerren got started in design, the value in teaching yourself new skills, the differences in working agency vs. product, and how to transition from making to managing. Dan and Gerren also chat about what Creative Market and Dribbble have in common, community and company culture, and his team’s newest product, Creative Market Pro.</p> <p>“Design and creativity, but design, in particular, has been continually decentralized and democratized and more and more people are being brought into the fold at a certain level of design thinking and execution, even if it’s not their formal day job. We’re having to look at that and find those people to talk to, to see how we can help them and serve their needs too, and it’s really exciting to be a part of that whole movement.”</p> <p><em>This episode is brought to you by Wix.

Rejection, Perseverance, and Design Matters with Debbie Millman
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
<p>Debbie Millman has worked with some of the world's biggest brands including Burger King, Hershey’s, Haagen-Dazs, Twizzlers—just to name a few. She's written six books, is a frequent keynote speaker on design and branding, and she hosts the first and longest running podcast about design, <a href="https://www.designmattersmedia.com/designmatters">Design Matters</a>.</p> <p>In this episode, we discuss the drawing that started it all, why rejection can be worse than failure, how Design Matters got started, and why persistence is the key to success.</p> <p>“I don't think it's possible to make a name for yourself doing work for other people. I think that the way you make a name for yourself is doing original work on your own. Which doesn't mean you have to quit your job to do it. I was doing Design Matters while I had two full-time jobs.”</p> <p><em>This episode is brought to you by Wix.
